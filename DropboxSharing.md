# File sharing

Generally we should get in the practice of using github as repository for files that we are sharing. The version control through this method is better than dropbox. However, learning the ins and outs of managing github repos takes sometime, and in the meantime there are other methods. 

For example, this repo (testMe) was created using the webpage interface, and this markdown document was created using the webinterface (and saved as .md so that it renders as a markdown). It is easy to edit and add to this document directly within the github webpage. 

## Sharing files with Dropbox

One simple way to share files is to place links in this document that reference dropbox folders or files. Any folder or file in dropbox can be assigned an html link (do this in the finder on a mac, or in dropbox), then posted in a document link this. Other people will be able to access the links and download support files. From a user perspective, it is easy to move files in and out of dropbox folders, so this is one fast and easy to get sharing up and going. However, this method comes at the cost of losing githubs version control.

Here's an example
