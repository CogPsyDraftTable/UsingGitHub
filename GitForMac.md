# Repository Basics

1. Get a GitHub account, it's free
2. Download GitHub for Mac, it's a free program for easy sharing between repositories on Github, and repositories on your local machine.

## Creating a repository from the GitHub webpage

1. Go to your user page on GitHub, click on the Repositories Tab, click the big green New Button. Give the new repository a name. You're done. You can add new text files directly through the web by following similar steps.

The new repository can now be expanded in various ways. You can clone a copy of it onto your local machine. You can make changes to the files on your (and of course add new files), then push those changes back onto the cloud version (which could be the gold-standard version of the files in the repository). All of the changes will be tracked and recorded.

## Cloning a repository from the GitHub Webpage onto your local machine.

1. Download Github for Mac (there ought to be some linux or windows equivalent?).
2. Enter your GitHub user info in the preferences
3. Click the "+" sign  on the top left corner. This let's you do different things like add, create and clone. Choose clone.
4. If you have existing repositories in your user account (for example, you made a test repo using via the webpage), then this repo should show up. Simply click the repo you want to clone, then name a folder where you want the clone to reside. Now, the entire repository will be in that folder on your local machine.

## Syncing the local folder back to the GitHub cloud 
1. If you have successfully cloned a repository, then you can just go to that folder and work on the files in that folder in the way you normally would. Open the files, make changes, add new files etc.
2. When you want to resync the changes that you made on your local machine to the cloud version of the repo, open up GitHub for Mac, click on the name of the repo that you have been working on, simply press the sync button on the top right-hand corner (you can also make a note to yourself if you want about the nature of the changes that were made by clicking on the changes tab before you sync and writing the note).
