Using GitHub for our collaborative research network
======

This is a test build of a github repository. My plan is to use this repository as method for us to explore github services. I will be adding info here over the next bit that will hopefully help with the orientation (but I'm still learning too). Please feel free to weigh in yourself and add things.

## Repositories, Git, and GitHub basics

Repositories are collections of files. In the context of software development, repositories would generally include all of the scripts and documentation for a given software development project. We get to flexibly decide how we want our repositories to work. One obvious structure would be to make individual repositories around specific projects. Repositories could include experiment script files, collected data, analysis files, drafts of manuscripts etc. 

Git is freely available verion control software. It can be installed on your local machine. Version control is simply the ability to store records of the history of modifications to files. Git provides this functionality for any files that are inside a git repository.

GitHub is this website. It provides cloud-based git repositories. If you have Git on your local machine, you can create repositories locally, and load them into cloud. And, you can download repositories from the cloud onto the local machine. GitHub also provides many project management and social networking features. All of your individual contributions to changing or adding content for GitHub repositories will be recorded on your user profile. 

GitHub Repositories like this one are containers for files inside the repository. Whole repositories can be downloaded easily as a .zip file from the main GitHub website without using Git. Clicking into a repository opens up a number of useful tools at the repository level.

1. Individual .txt files can be modified directly from the website
2. The icons on the sidebar offer things like boards, issues, and wikis
3. Boards can be used to set up a structure for threaded discussions
4. Issues can be used to post comments, and comments on comments to produce threaded discussion. Posted comments can be given different labels.
