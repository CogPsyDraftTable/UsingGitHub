# Sharing PDF libraries with Zotero

I've been using Zotero as a tool for managing collections of PDFs, and as a bibliography manager. There is a web-based version of Zotero.

https://www.zotero.org/

And, from there you can download an app version of Zotero (runs cross platform, and there are iphone and ipad, not sure about android apps that work too for viewing whole pdf libraries when you're on the town).

If you have multiple computers, a web-based zotero account (free, but can be upgraded for extra storage), and the app on your different computers, then Zotero automatically syncs the pdf libaries across computers.

There are plugins for web-browswers that offer functionality for rapidly downloading lists of pdfs from google scholar and other sites.

It is also possible to have shared Zotero libraries with multiple users.

# Sharing PDF libraries on GitHub

We should NOT be using GitHub storage space for PDFs (although it is an option...note each repository is meant to be under 1GB, so there would be plenty of room). 

Instead, I'll illustrate one way to conveniently share Zotero libraries. I am curating my own Zotero Folder containing my own published works. It's a folder in my local Zotero app. To share stuff like this, simply right-click on the folder, and export collection (check include files if it is not already checked) as a Zotero RDF (there are other options too so that the collection can be imported into other PDF and bibliography managers). I've just done this for my folder, and then placed it in my Dropbox and generated a public link to a .zip file.

https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14462007/articles/CrumpZotero.zip

Anyone could now download this file from that link, unzip the folder, then using Zotero, do an import by clicking on the .rdf file that is generated. This should pop the whole library into your Zotero app. This could be an efficient strategy for sharing PDF resources at the level of individual projects.
